# TRON CLI - Python

My attempt to make a command line interface helper inspired by the movie Tron.
In the movie Flynn college, Allen, wrote a security program  called Tron. I thought it would be cool to name my utility the same. It's not a security program or an ai. Though, it has the potential to be the starting point of all my automation of boring stuff. I needed a place to start gathering all my scrips and tools.


# USAGE
### Duplicate File
```
tron file -d 'myFolder/myFile.txt'
```
creates ```myfile_000.txt```

### Backup File
```
tron file -d 'myFolder/myFile.txt'
```
creates ```myFile_backup.txt```

# Installation
```
git clone http://github.com/patomation/indeed-scraper ~/.tron
```

```
echo 'alias indeed="python ~/.tron/"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

## Getting Started
Install all the dependencies in requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Development
Install virtual environment
```
$ python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
```
Create New Environment:

$ python3 -m venv env
python 2:
$ python -m virtualenv env
```
Activate environment
```
source env/bin/activate
```
Deactivate Environment
```

```
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Save dependencies:
